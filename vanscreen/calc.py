			The datasets should have variables named: 
				Bx, By, Bz 
			which provide three-axis measurements in nanoTesla

			The datasets should have the following properties:

				Distance - distance from the center of the object to the front of
				   the magnetometer plastic packaging

				Offset_cm - Three component offsets from the external sensor
					casing to the center of each magnetometer, in centimeters.

			More datasets are better, but at a minimum of two are needed to
			project the object's effects out to a distance of one meter.
