	motion.

	Args:
	lDsRaw (list[semcsv.Dataset]): A list of raw datasets from three-axis
		magnetometers in the presence of a slowly rotating object.

		The datasets should have variables named: 
			Offset, Bx, By, Bz
		which provide three-axis measurements in nanoTesla and relative 
		times for each measurment

		The datasets should have the following properties:

		Distance - distance from the center of the object to the front of the
		           magnetometer plastic packaging

		Offset_cm - Three component offsets from the external sensor
		            casing to the center of each magnetometer, in centimeters.

		More datasets are preferred, but a least two are required.

		aDist [m]:           Original sensor distance poisitions
		aRate [Hz]:          The measured rotation rate of the object at each distance
		aBmax [T]:           The dipole component only field values at each distance
		rMoment [N m T**-1]: The calculated dipole moment
		rMomErr [N n T**-1]: The estimated error in the dipole moment calculation

	Note: If the measured rotation rate is far from the know value then 
		   the assumptions built into this calculation may not be correct.
